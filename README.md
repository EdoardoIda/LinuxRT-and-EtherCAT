Repository holding codes and instruction to install a linux rt pc, an ethercat master (opensource, developed by Ingenieurgemeinschaft IgH) and use it to program a simple slave device: an arduino due with an ethercat shield (developed by AB&T).
In this way it show how to start developing with ethercat technology even with limited funds. In addition, the application notes of this repo can be used as a powerful HOWTO guide to make the first steps into real time programming, ethercat and automation concept in general.
