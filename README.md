# LinuxRT-and-EtherCAT

Repository holding codes and instruction to install a linux rt pc, an ethercat master (opensource, developed by Ingenieurgemeinschaft IgH) and use it to program a simple slave device: an arduino due with an ethercat shield (developed by AB&T).
It shows how to start developing with ethercat technology even with limited funds. In addition, the application notes of this repo can be used as a HOWTO guide to make the first steps into real time programming, ethercat and automation concepts in general.
